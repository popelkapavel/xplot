
This is the beta release of Xplot, a 3D ploting program for X11.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
To compile, just type 

  make;

in this directory. You may have to edit the "CC= gcc -O4" line in
the Makefile if you don't have gcc (or you don't want to use gcc :-(

-----------------------------------------------------------------
To install, edit the first two lines in the Makefile in this directory
and then do a

make install;

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The doc directory contains a simple LaTeX document "tutor.tex",
You need to do "latex tutor.tex" twice to get the table of contents
right.  I recommand you to print out a copy since  the online
help in this beta version is very sketchy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The example directory contains a set of simples objects. 
They can be loaded  via the 'load' command.
