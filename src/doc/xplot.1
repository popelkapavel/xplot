NAME
     xplot  --a 3D function plotting program under X11.

SYNOPSIS
     xplot	

DESCRIPTION
       XPLOT is a command and menu driven interactive plotting
     program for X windows.  Currently it only runs on 8 bit 
     pseudo color visuals. 

       XPLOT reads instructions from  the  standard in and produces
     plots based on these  instructions. Once a plot is done, the 
     plotted graphical objects can be manipulated by  mouse input.

       XPLOT is also an data viewer. Currently, it only knows
     object in OFF format or in MESH format.

       For a complete description, please read the xplot tutorial.

	
EXAMPLES:
              In[1] : f(x,y) = sin(x) * cos(y);
              In[2] : example1 = surface{[f(x,y)][x=-pi:pi][y=-6:6]}
  	      In[3] : example2 = curve{[x,sin(x),0][x=0:10]}
              In[4] : example3 = tube{[sin(x),cos(x),0][x=0:2*pi][radius=0.1]}
              In[5] : plot example1, example2, example3;
